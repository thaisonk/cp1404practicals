# Line 1:
# I saw a random number between 5 and 20
# Smallest possible number was 5
# Largest possible number was 20

# Line 2:
# I saw a random odd number between 3 and 9
# Smallest possible number was 3
# Largest possible number was 9
# Could line 2 have produced a 4? No as the step is 2 so only odd numbers are given

# Line 3:
# I saw a random floating point number between 2.5 and 5.5.
# Smallest possible number was 2.5
# Largest possible number was 5.5
